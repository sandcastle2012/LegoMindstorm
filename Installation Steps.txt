A. Infra Red (IR) Tower Driver Installation
-------------------------------------------
The IR tower is used for downloading programs to the Minstorm Brick (RCX). It is supposed to be connected to the computer/laptop via RS232 serial cable.

However, since most modern computers and laptops do not come with RS232, you need to use a USB to Serial converter cable. This is available from most electronics stores.

Step 1
	- Before you connect the cable you need to install a driver as follow:
	- If you are installing on a new laptop/computer (Windows 7/8 or 10) then most likely you won't need a driver (but there is a driver CD that comes with the cable)
	- If you are installing on Vista then run the vista driver installer under <this directory>\IR Tower - USB Drivers\Lego_IR_tower_driver_vista\Setup.exe
	- If you are installing on XP then run the XP driver installer under <this directory>\IR Tower - USB Drivers\LegoTower (XP)\Setup.exe 

Step 2
	- Connect the tower to your PC to complete the installation. The green LED inside the IR tower should briefly turn on after the installation
	-  Check that the green light turns on every time the tower is connected to the USB port on your PC.
	- Now your IR tower is ready to transmit data.


B. Troubleshooting Infra Red (IR) Serial Port Number and Settings
-----------------------------------------------------------------
If the IR Tower is working fine then skip this section to the next one

Both the Mindstorm and NQC tools expects the Serial Port of the IR Tower to be in the range Port 1 through Port 4, you may need to use the Windows Device Manager to change the port number if it is different. (go to Device Manager and expand the Ports (COM &LPT) and check the port number. DOuble click on the entry associated with the USB-to-Serial converter; Select Port Settings and then Advanced ... button  and change "COM Port Number").

Also, you may need to adjust the following:
	Bits per second: 	2400 or 1200
	Data Bits:		8
	Parity:			Odd
	Stop Bits:		1
	Flow Control:		None
If the IR Tower is not working then you may need to experiment with these settings.


C. Install Bricxcc (Bricx Command Center)
-----------------------------------------
Bricx Command Center is the integrated development environment (IDE) of Next Byte Codes, Not Quite C and Not eXactly C. These programming languages are used to program the Robots in the Lego Mindstorms series.

	- Go to Bricxcc directory and locate bricxcc_setup_3389.exe 
		(or Download the latest release of bricxcc 3.3.8.9 (bricxcc 3.3.8.9) from https://sourceforge.net/projects/bricxcc/files/bricxcc/)
	- DOuble click on the executable file bricxcc_setup_3389.exe to install 

D. Install NQC Compiler
------------------------
	- Locate or Download NQC nqc-win-3-1-r6.zip from http://bricxcc.sourceforge.net/nqc/
	- Right click on the nqc-win-3-1-r6.zip file and click on Extract to Folder ... 
	- Open the decompressed directory nqc-win-3-1-r6 and 
	- Copy (or move) the nqc.exe file to the same directory that contains the bricxcc.exe file (See C. Install Bricxcc (Bricx Command Center)). 
	

E. Download the RCX Firmware (if necessary)
--------------------------------------------
	- Locate firm0309.lgo: RCX firmware version 3.09 (or download it from https://pbrick.info/rcx-firmware/) 
		This version came with the LEGO MindStorms Robotics Invention System version 1.0 and 1.5.
	- Copy (or move) the nqc.exe file to the same directory that contains the bricxcc.exe file (See C. Install Bricxcc (Bricx Command Center)). 
	- Install the firmware as follow:
		-- Connect your Lego IR Tower to the computer USB port (as described in step A. above)
		-- Place your RCX in front of the tower (Infrared ports facing each other), turn the RCX on.
		-- Launch the Bricxcc IDE
		-- Go to the Tools menu and select Download Firmware
		-- Locate the firmware file on your computer ( C:\bricxcc\firm0309.lgo) and press ok
		This will take up to three minutes. The firmware will stay in Brick's RAM as long as the batteries are not dead.

F. Have Fun Building robots and programs
----------------------------------------
	- Use Dave Baum's Definitive Guide to Lego Mindstorms book (there is a CD with examples and projects) as a guide
	- A short tutorial is NQC_Tutorial.pdf (Programming Lego Robots using NQC by Mark Overmars and John Hansen)
	- There are many websites and YouTube videos on NQC and Mindstorm
